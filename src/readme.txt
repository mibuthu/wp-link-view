== Installation ==

The easiest version of installing is to go to the admin page. There you can install new plugins in the menu **Plugins -> Add new**. Search for **Link View** and press **Install now**.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it possible to use the shortcode in a widget? =
Yes, a widget especially for the use of the [linkview] shortcode is included in this plugin. Insert the widget LinkView in your sidebar and set all attributes you want to change in the appropriate field.

= Is it possible to add multiple slider on one site? =
Yes, since version 0.3.0 you can use as many sliders as you want on one site.

= Can I call the shortcode directly via php e.g. for my own template, theme or plugin? =
Yes, you can create an instance of the `SC_Linkview` class which is located in `php/sc_linkview.php` in the plugin folder and call the function `show_html($atts)`. With `$atts` you can specify all the shortcode attributes you require. Another possibility would be to call the WordPress function `do_shortcode()`.
